                        The <a href="/about">Genome Aggregation Database</a> (gnomAD) is a resource developed by an international coalition of investigators, with the goal of aggregating and harmonizing both exome and genome sequencing data from a wide variety of large-scale sequencing projects, and making summary data available for the wider scientific community.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The data set provided on this website spans 123,136 exome sequences and 15,496 whole-genome sequences from unrelated individuals sequenced as part of various disease-specific and population genetic studies. The gnomAD Principal Investigators and groups that have contributed data to the current release are listed <a href="/about">here</a>.

                <div>
                    <p>TGAC is a data resource that aims to improve our understanding of the phenotypic consequence of genetic variation.  Exome and genome data from patients in contributing cohorts are available to view in aggregate via this browser.  This project is designed to enable further study of individuals via genomic ascertainment without prior knowledge of phenotype.</p>
                    <p>The initial dataset included in this beta release of the TGAC Browser comprises exomes from 938 participants in the NHGRI-sponsored ClinSeq® study.  We plan to add more exome and genome data from other investigators soon.  See <a href="/about" target="_blank">“About The Genomic Ascertainment Cohort”</a></i> for information about this effort. This project is a collaboration between NHGRI (Les Biesecker) and NIAMS (Richard Siegel).</p>
                    <p>All data here are released under a <a href="https://www.genome.gov/pages/research/wellcomereport0303.pdf">Fort Lauderdale Agreement</a> for the benefit of the IRP community. Please read and understand that agreement before using the data.</p>
                   <p>Our team will facilitate the use of TGAC for your proposed project, including the process of contacting the individuals identified as having variants of interest.  If you have a research project that you would like to propose, please complete the <a href="/application" target="_blank">project proposal form</a>.</p>

                    <p>This  project is designed to make exome and genome data from intramural patient cohorts as well as external collaborators such as INOVA more widely available and to facilitate genomic ascertainment research studies, both basic and clinical, within the Intramural Research Program (IRP).</p>
                    <p>The initial dataset included in this beta release of the TGAC Browser comprises exomes from 938 participants in the NHGRI-sponsored ClinSeq<sup>&reg;</sup> study<sup>&#9733;</sup>. Nearly all of them are unrelated. We plan to add more exome and genome data from other investigators soon. Our goal here is to pilot approaches to genomic ascertainment research studies in the IRP.
