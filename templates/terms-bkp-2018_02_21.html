            <h4>Terms of Use</h4>
            <p>All data here are released under a <a href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/stellent/groups/corporatesite/@policy_communications/documents/web_document/wtd003207.pdf" target="_blank">Fort Lauderdale Agreement</a> for the benefit of the intramural community. You are encouraged to search the data, primarily for the purpose of identifying participants who may have variants of interest upon whom &#40;or upon whose samples&#41; you propose to perform post-hoc phenotyping or functional studies. We ask that you not publish global &#40;genome-wide&#41; analyses of these data, or of large gene sets. Such data use would more appropriately be sourced from dbGAP.</p>
            <h4>Citation in Publications</h4>
            <p>We request that any use of data obtained from the TGAC browser be cited in publications using the following format:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><em>The Genomic Ascertainment Cohort &#40;TGAC&#41;, Bethesda, MD &#40;URL: http://tgac.nhgri.nih.gov&#41; &#91;date &#40;month, year&#41; accessed&#93;</em>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We also ask that the Consortium be acknowledged as follows:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><em>The authors thank The Genomic Ascertainment Cohort and the groups that provided exome variant data for comparison. A full list of contributing groups can be found at <a href="/about">http://tgac.nhgri.nih.gov/about</a></em>.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Data Generation</h4>
	    <p>The current data release &#40;0.1&#41; was initially generated across a combined data set of 938 exomes from the ClinSeq cohort. For more information on ClinSeq see Biesecker LG, et al. The ClinSeq Project: piloting large-scale genome sequencing for research in genomic medicine. Genome Res. 2009;19(9):1665-74. [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=PMC2752125" target="_blank">PubMed</a>]</p>
            <p>Exome sequencing data was processed through a pipeline based on &#40;would ask NISC to complete this&#41;.</p>
