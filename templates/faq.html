            <h4>How should I cite discoveries made using TGAC data?</h4>
            <p>We request that any use of data obtained from the TGAC browser be cited in publications using the following format:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><em>The Genomic Ascertainment Cohort &#40;TGAC&#41;, Bethesda, MD &#40;URL: http://tgac.nhgri.nih.gov&#41; &#91;date &#40;month, year&#41; accessed&#93;</em>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>I have identified a rare variant in TGAC that I believe is associated with a specific clinical phenotype. What phenotype data are available for these individuals?</h4>
            <p>This is the intent and strength of TGAC, as compared to other databases &#45; we very much want to provide these data to you. Some phenotype data are already collected. The data dictionary for ClinSeq participants is located at (link to data dictionary page).</p>

            <h4>What genome build is the TGAC data based on?</h4>
            <p>All data are based on GRCh37/hg19.</p>

            <h4>What version of dbSNP was used to annotate variants?</h4>
            <p>dbSNP 144.</p>

            <h4>What version of Gencode was used to annotate variants?</h4>
            <p>Version 27 (annotated with VEP version 90).</p>

            <h4>What are the restrictions on data usage?</h4>
            <p>All data here are released under a <a href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/stellent/groups/corporatesite/@policy_communications/documents/web_document/wtd003207.pdf" target="_blank">Fort Lauderdale Agreement</a> for the benefit of the intramural biomedical community. See the <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a> page for details.</p>

            <h4>How do I report a suspected bug in the TGAC website?</h4>
            <p>Please email the TGAC <a href='mailto:justin.paschall@nih.gov,tyra.wolfsberg@nih.gov' target="_blank">Informatics Team</a></p>


            <h4>How do I contact the TGAC team if I wish to propose an evaluation of a patient from this dataset?</h4>
            <p>If you find a variant in this dataset and have a research project that you would like to propose, please complete the <a href="/application" target="_blank">project proposal form</a></p>

                    Most of the individuals who have contributed data to gnomAD were not fully consented for phenotype data sharing, and unfortunately at this time we are typically unable to provide any information about the clinical status of variant carriers. We have made every effort to exclude individuals with severe pediatric diseases from the gnomAD data set, and certainly do not expect our data set to be <i>enriched</i> for such individuals, but we typically cannot rule out the possibility that some of our participants do actually suffer from your disease of interest.

                    <h4 class="media-heading">Can I get access to individual-level genotype data from gnomAD?</h4>
                    Many of the samples in gnomAD have individual-level sequencing data deposited in <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap">dbGaP</a>, and these can be accessed by <a href="https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?page=login">applying through that repository</a>. However, many other samples come from unpublished cohorts or from samples not in dbGaP. There is not currently any mechanism to systematically obtain individual-level genotype data from the database as a whole. Making this possible would require a truly staggering amount of paperwork, and we'd rather spend that time generating larger data sets for the community to use.

                    There are no restrictions or embargoes on the publication of results derived from the gnomAD database. However, we encourage people to <a href="mailto:exomeconsortium@gmail.com">check with the consortium</a> before embarking on large-scale analyses, to see if we already have something currently underway that overlaps with your plans; generally, we prefer to collaborate with users rather than compete with them.

                    <h4 class="media-heading">Why does the browser seem to disagree with the gnomAD VCF at this multiallelic site?</h4>
                    Due to the limitations of the VCF format, multi-allelic variants are put together on one VCF line.
                    This inevitably adds complexity to otherwise simple variants,
                    and thus when parsing onto the browser, we apply a <a href="http://www.cureffi.org/2014/04/24/converting-genetic-variants-to-their-minimal-representation/">minimal representation</a> script.
                    For instance, a variant whose REF is GC and ALT alleles are TC,G - the first ALT allele is actually a SNP and will be represented in the browser as G->T.

                    <h4 class="media-heading">Are all the individuals in the <a href="http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/">Exome Variant Server</a> included?</h4>
                    No. We were not given permission from dbGaP to include individuals from several of the cohorts included in the NHLBI's Exome Sequencing Project. As a result, genuine rare variants that are present in the EVS may not be observed in gnomAD.

                    <h4 class="media-heading">Do the cancer samples in the database include tumor exomes, or is this from germline samples only?</h4>
                    All of the "cancer" samples in the current release of ExAC are blood ("germline") samples from TCGA. We excluded any sample labeled as tumor. However, note that some sample/label swaps may have occurred in TCGA; in addition, it is possible that in some patients the blood samples are contaminated by circulating tumor cells.
