	<h1>Terms and Data Information</h1>
  <h4>Terms of Use</h4>
  <p>All data here are released under a <a href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/stellent/groups/corporatesite/@policy_communications/documents/web_document/wtd003207.pdf" target="_blank">Fort Lauderdale Agreement <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> for the benefit of the intramural community. You are encouraged to search the data, primarily for the purpose of identifying participants who may have variants of interest upon whom (or upon whose samples) you propose to perform post-hoc phenotyping or functional studies. We ask that you not publish global (genome-wide) analyses of these data, or of large gene sets. Such data use would more appropriately be sourced from dbGAP.</p>

	<h4>Citation in Publications</h4>
	<p>We request that any use of data obtained from the TGAC browser be cited in publications using the following format:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><em>The Genomic Ascertainment Cohort (TGAC), Bethesda, MD (URL: http://tgac.nhgri.nih.gov) &#91;date (month, year) accessed&#93;</em>.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>We also ask that the Consortium be acknowledged as follows:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><em>The authors thank The Genomic Ascertainment Cohort and the groups that provided exome variant data for comparison. A full list of contributing groups can be found at <a href="/about">http://tgac.nhgri.nih.gov/about</a></em>.</li>
	</ul>
  
	<h4>Data Generation</h4>
	<p>The current data release (0.1) was initially generated across a combined data set of 938 exomes from the ClinSeq cohort. For more information on ClinSeq see Biesecker LG, et al. The ClinSeq Project: piloting large-scale genome sequencing for research in genomic medicine. Genome Res. 2009;19(9):1665-74. [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=PMC2752125" target="_blank">PubMed <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>]</p>
	<p>Exome sequencing data was processed through a pipeline based on the <a href="https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/best-practices/workflow?id=11145"  target="_blank">GATK Best Practices <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> for germline variant calling.</p>
